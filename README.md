# WAKES_SHM
SHM for WTGs with wakes

# OBJECTIVES
- Explore and explain the difference in dynamics for an upwind vs a downwind (wake affected) wind turbine.
- Predict the dynamic response/loads/kinematics of a wake affected wind turbine given the dynamic response/loads/kinematics and uncertain upwind inflow conditions of a free-stream wind turbine.
- Illucidate which sensors are most sensitive to discreminating wake dynamics

# COMPUTATIONAL SETUP
- FAST/DWM
- Two turbines
- Uncertainties: inflow conditions, aerodynamic propoerties, distance between turbines, material fatigue properties
